  :title: Pancakes
  :ingredients:
  - 1⁄2 cup honey
  - 1⁄2 cup blood orange juice, strained
  - 1 1⁄2 teaspoons cornstarch or 1 1⁄2 teaspoons cornflour
  - 1 tablespoon butter
  - 8 ounces fresh strawberries, quarter
  - 1 1⁄2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
  - 3 1⁄2 teaspoons baking powder, sifted
  - 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, sifted
  - 1 tablespoon white sugar, sifted
  - 1 egg
  - 3 tablespoons butter, melted and slightly cooled
  - 1 1⁄2 cups milk
  - cooking spray, for pan
  :instructions:
  - 'Blood Orange Honey Sauce: In small saucepan, add honey, blood orange juice and
    cornflour, whisk well until sauce ingredients are blended.'
  - Put saucepan over a medium heat and bring mixture to a boil, whisking occasionally
    and cook until sauce starts to boil, then remove from heat.
  - Whisk in butter until completely dissolved into the sauce. Set aside and allow
    cooling until pancakes are ready.
  - 'Pancake: In a large bowl, add sifted flour, baking powder, salt and sugar, mix
    well and make a small well in the centre of the bowl with the dried ingredients.'
  - Add the egg in centre of the well, then add melted butter, slowly add milk and
    mix until smooth. (You may not need to add the entire 1 1/2 cups of milk, consistence
    of mixture needs to be smooth).
  - Using the cooking spray, lightly oil pancake pan or non stick frying pan over
    medium heat.
  - 'Once pan is hot, pour approximately 1/4 cup of pancake mixture onto the pan.
    Brown on one side of pancake then flip, brown other side of pancake, place cooked
    pancake onto a warm plate. Repeat this step until all the pancake mixture has
    completed. Note: Only flip once as pancake will become tough and not light.'
  - 'To assemble: Equally divided pancakes on four plates. Equally pour blood orange
    honey sauce on top of the pancakes and then add strawberries on top of the sauce.'
